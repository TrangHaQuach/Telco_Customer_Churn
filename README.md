# Telco_Customer_Churn
Most mobile operators have historical records on which customers ended up churning and which continued using their services. This historical information can be used to construct a ML model of one telecom operatorâ€™s churn using a process called training. After training and testing the model, we can pass the profile information of a random customer to predict whether this customer is going to churn or not.
